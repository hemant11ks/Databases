Databases are broadly categorized based on their structure, data storage, and use cases. Here are the main types:

Relational Databases (RDBMS)

Data is organized into tables with rows and columns.
Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle DB.
Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)

Stores data in formats like key-value pairs, documents, or graphs.
Example: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.
Hierarchical Databases

Data is organized in a tree-like structure.
Example: IBM Information Management System (IMS).
Network Databases

Data is represented using a graph structure with nodes and relationships.
Example: Integrated Data Store (IDS).
Object-Oriented Databases

Stores data as objects, similar to object-oriented programming.
Example: db4o, ObjectDB.
Distributed Databases

Data is stored across multiple locations or servers.
Example: Google Bigtable, Apache Cassandra.
Cloud Databases

Managed on cloud platforms with scalability and accessibility features.
Example: Amazon RDS, Google Cloud Spanner.
Time-Series Databases

Optimized for time-stamped data, such as logs or metrics.
Example: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB.
Graph Databases

Focus on relationships between entities, represented as nodes and edges.
Example: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune.
Key-Value Databases

Store data as key-value pairs for fast retrieval.
Example: DynamoDB, Redis.
